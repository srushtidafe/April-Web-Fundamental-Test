
//What is the difference between null , undefined and not defined

//null:-

//The code suggests that the variable is empty at the moment and may have a value later
//Null is a reserved keyword in javascript.                   
//Example:-

let d  = null;
console.log(d);    



//undefined:-

//If a variable is declared but the value is not assigned, then the value of that variable will be undefined.
// Un-defined: when no value is Assigned to a variable, the value is called "un-defined".
//Example:-

let j;
console.log(j); 




//not defined:-

//Not-defined: when the variable is not present in your code, the value is called "not-defined".
//Example:-

//console.log(k);
